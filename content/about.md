Hi! I'm a [Computer Science and Design](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate/curriculum-overview/) undergraduate in the **Cybersecurity Track**. I have a general interest in seeing how things work behind the scenes, and my current interest lies in expanding my knowledge in malware analysis and rootkits.

# Experiences
My expertise so far largely lies in software development and cybersecurity fundamentals.
- **[MiniScript Interpreter](https://github.com/Rye123/miniscript)**: As a project, we wrote an LL(2) compiler and interpreter for the MiniScript language, written in C.
- **[Peer-to-peer Directory Sync](https://github.com/Rye123/50012-networks-project)**: As a networking project, we wrote a peer-to-peer directory syncing solution, written in Python 3.
- **[Search-and-Rescue Drone Project](https://github.com/masnrd/drone_ws)**:  As a Capstone project, my team and I worked on search-and-rescue drones. I developed ROS 2 Python code to operate the drone in offboard mode, and assisted in developing a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) spoofing solution to improve the detectability of cellphone signals.
- **[ascii-3d](https://github.com/Rye123/ascii-3d)**: A very basic 3D renderer for ASCII written in Python 3, to find out how the graphics pipeline worked.
- **[otp_gen](https://github.com/Rye123/otp_gen)**: A command-line tool to generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) written in Python.
- **Internship Experience**: As part of my internship in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), I worked on integrating data from disparate sources into a graph database using Python 3.
- **CTFs**: I have some experience in capture-the-flag competitions, specifically enjoying problems in binary exploitation and reverse engineering.

# Currently Working On
Currently, I'm working on building a homelab for malware analysis, so I can begin exploring the exercises in [Practical Malware Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Hands-Dissecting/dp/1593272901) and other reverse engineering material I have not have had the time to peruse.
